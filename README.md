# music_structure-segmentator
A simplification to segment a wav file and get the music form structure.

I was analizing some songs for a personal project and found the [msaf](https://github.com/urinieto/msaf) repository
done by [Oriol Nieto](https://github.com/urinieto). The library seems to be very robust but I needed just a
simple way to give a song and get the boundaries and a simple image.

Here is my simplification (which of course has the original software as dependency),
you just need to specify a path for a wav, and the methods.
